# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains my projects on data analysis and machine learning in Python. Different techniques are covered, including choropleth maps, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, recommender systems, natural language processing, artificial neural networks.

## Supervised Learning
##### **Quantitative Prediction: House Prices**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jx22553/data-science-projects/blob/master/notebooks/Predicting%20House%20Prices.ipynb) 

Based on a wide range of characteristics describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this project focused on building a regression model to predict the sale price. Tested against various statistical models, including Ridge Regression, Lasso Linear Model, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms, to maximize prediction accuracy.

##### **Classification Prediction: Passengers Survived on Titanic**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jx22553/data-science-projects/blob/master/notebooks/Predicting%20Passenger%20Survival%20on%20Titanic%20Tragedy.ipynb) 

Created a binary classification prediction model with the Random Forest algorithm using information about Titanic passengers to predict whether they survived or not.

##### **Classification Prediction: Loan Payback**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jx22553/data-science-projects/blob/master/notebooks/Loan%20Payback%20Classification.ipynb) 

Based on characteristics describing customers and whether if their loans are already paid off or defaulted, this projected focused on building a binary classification model to predict the possibility of paying off a loan. Tested against various statistical models, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression algorithms, to maximize prediction accuracy.

## Unsupervised Learning
##### **Unsupervised Clustering: Finding Best Location for New Restaurant**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jx22553/data-science-projects/blob/master/notebooks/Start-up%20Restaurant%20Finding%20Best%20Location%20with%20Clustering.ipynb) 

Built a KMeans Cluster model to segment Toronto neighborhoods based on location demographics, frequency of cultural distribution, and median household incomes from web scraping data and the Foursquare API to determine the best location to open a Japanese restaurant.

## Recommender System
##### **Restaurant Recommendation System**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jx22553/data-science-projects/blob/master/notebooks/Restaurant%20Recommendation%20System.ipynb) 

Utilized a Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering approach to implement user-based and item-based recommendation systems based on customer ratings of different restaurants

## Natural Language Processing
##### **Natural Language Processing: Yelp Reviews**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jx22553/data-science-projects/blob/master/notebooks/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20on%20Yelp%20Reviews.ipynb) 

Created a machine learning algorithm, using Python’s NLTK library, that classifies Yelp reviews into 1 star or 5 star rating based off of text content in the reviews

## Artificial Neural Network
##### **Deep Learning: LendingClub Loan Payoff Likelihood**

[Notebook](https://github.com/jx22553/data-science-projects/blob/master/notebooks/LendingClub%20Loan%20Payoff%20Likelihood%20using%20ANN.ipynb) 

Engineered an Artificial Neural Network using Python’s TensorFlow Keras API to predict whether a borrower will pay back their loan with over 90% accuracy, given historical data on loans given out by LendingClub.
